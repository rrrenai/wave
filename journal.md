# May 22nd: Starting!

Hello, today I started writing my project pitch. I created my BOM and look at some other projects for inspiration.

Here's what I have so far:
![5/22/2025 BOM](./journal_images/5.22_BOM.png)

I want to create something that can listen to omnidirectional audio and significantly clean up the output. I hope to help people with hearing problems.
